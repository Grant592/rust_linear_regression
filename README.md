# Linear Regression in Rust

In the process of learning rust so made a simple linear regression with gradient descent. It's currently setup to just run the example file provided but I'll be aiming make it much more general for accepting other datasets. If anyone sees this and has any feedback on the 'rust-yness' of my code then feedback is always welcome. It's quite the steep learning curve coming from predominantly python.
